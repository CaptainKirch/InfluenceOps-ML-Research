This repository documents:
✅ Key academic papers + takeaways  
✅ Tools, datasets, and libraries relevant to automated influence detection  
✅ Personal reflections + research notes on ideological capture, social system modeling, and adversarial ML

Purpose:
To build an open, evolving knowledge base that supports the development of EchoAI and related projects addressing automated influence and social amplification in the age of AI.

Topics covered include:
- Bot detection methods
- Graph and network analysis
- Influence modeling and diffusion
- Adversarial ML in social systems
- Real-world disinformation campaigns

Maintained by Liam, as part of a long-term effort to understand and counter the systemic effects of automation on human belief formation.
